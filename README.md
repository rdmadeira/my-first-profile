# my-first-proyect
First proyect to familiarize with Github<br/>
Here I put the html pages created to train some html and css learnings.<br/>
I used html 5 and CSS3. All the multimedia files are in assets' folder and the css file is in the css' folder.<br/>
The content of this page is a single profile of me and the idea is adding more information by the time.<br/>
